<p><strong>JOSQUIN ATTRIBUTION DATA</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is significant debate on the proper attribution of a number of pieces 
    sometimes credited to Josquin </li>
  <li>Jesse Rodin has separated Josquin's music into six levels of attribution 
    security, based on historical research 
    <ul>
      <li>The Level 1 pieces are the most secure (i.e. are most likely to have 
        truly been composed by Josquin), and attribution becomes less secure as 
        the levels increase</li>
      <li>Pieces belonging to levels 1 and 2 can be reasonably expected to really 
        be by Josquin, the other four levels are more ambiguous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In this experiment, we will use machine learning to help us get a rough 
    overall idea of how reasonable (in general) the Rodin attribution levels are, 
    based only on the musical content itself 
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. not taking any external historical knowledge into account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To do this, we will train a classification model to distinguish the music 
    of the two most secure secure Josquin levels from the music of a variety of 
    other composers that were roughly his contemporaries</li>
  <li>We will then use this model to classify the music from the four least secure 
    Josquin levels 
    <ul>
      <li>If the music belonging to the more secure of these four levels is classified 
        as being by Josquin more often by this model then the music from the less 
        secure levels, then this is a good sign that there is musical backing 
        for Rodin's proposed attribution security levels</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is different from what we did in previous stages of this tutorial 
    <ul>
      <li>Previously, we did cross-validation on all the data at once, which means 
        that Weka automatically broke the data into its own training and testing 
        sets, for the purpose of seeing how well it was able to distinguish the 
        music</li>
      <li>Here, we are going to manually separate out the training data and testing 
        data (i.e. the music we are going to classify) separately</li>
      <li>This will allow us to see how each piece in the testing data is actually 
        classified individually</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>IMPORTANT:</em> the training data must never share any pieces with the 
    testing data, otherwise results may be biased</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXTRACTING AND PRE-PROCESSING THE FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We will be working in the 03_Josquin_Attribution directory, which you downloaded 
    as part of this tutorial 
    <ul>
      <li>Using the approaches covered in the previous sections of this tutorial, 
        use jSymbolic (and the &quot;FeaturesThatAvoidBiasInRenMusictConfigs.txt&quot; 
        config file), to extract features from all the files in the &quot;JosquinNotJosquin_MIDI&quot; 
        folder 
        <ul>
          <li>Save the features as &quot;JosquinNotJosquinFeatureValues.xml&quot; 
            (and the associated ARFF and CSV files)</li>
          <li>These will be the features we will use to train the model</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Using jSymbolic (and the &quot;FeaturesThatAvoidBiasInRenMusictConfigs.txt&quot; 
        config file), extract features from all the files in the &quot;MaybeJosquin_MIDI&quot; 
        folder 
        <ul>
          <li>Save the features as &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValues.xml&quot; (and 
            the associated ARFF and CSV files)</li>
          <li>These will be the features we will classify with the model after 
            we train it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the spreadsheet editing approaches covered earlier in this tutorial 
    to create versions of the two CSV files jSymbolic just generated 
    <ul>
      <li>Save a version of &quot;JosquinNotJosquinFeatureValues.csv&quot; called 
        &quot;JosquinNotJosquinFeatureValuesWekaReady.csv&quot; where: 
        <ul>
          <li>A column has been added to the end called &quot;COMPOSER&quot;</li>
          <li>This column has been filled with entries of either &quot;Josquin&quot; 
            or &quot;NotJosquin&quot; for each piece, as appropriate for the given 
            piece </li>
          <li>The first column (where file paths are listed) has been deleted</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Save a version of &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValues.csv&quot; called &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValuesWekaReady.csv&quot; 
        where: 
        <ul>
          <li>A column has been added to the end called &quot;COMPOSER&quot;</li>
          <li>This column has been filled with entries of &quot;?&quot;' for each 
            and every piece 
            <ul>
              <li>Since we do not actually know who composed these pieces (although 
                it is of course suspected that many of them actually are by Josquin, 
                especially those nearer the top, which have a greater security 
                level)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The first column (where file paths are listed) has been deleted</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using the Weka skills you learned in previous parts of this tutorial, start 
    the Weka Explorer</li>
  <li>Using Weka, we will save the &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValues.csv&quot; testing data CSV file we just edited as a Weka 
    ARFF file 
    <ul>
      <li>This will differ from the ARFF file jSymbolic created directly, since 
        we have since edited the CSV file for this set to include class labels 
        under the header of &quot;COMPOSER&quot; </li>
      <li>In Weka, under the <em>Preprocess</em> tab, click on the <em>Open File 
        </em> button, and open the &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValuesWekaReady.csv&quot; 
        file 
        <ul>
          <li>Then, still in the Weka <em>Preprocess </em>tab, press the <em>Save</em> 
            button 
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure the <em>Files of Type</em> dropdown menu says &quot;Arff 
                data files (*.arff)&quot;</li>
              <li>Save the file as &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValuesComposerFieldAdded.arff&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We now need to perform a bit of a hack in order to make Weka be willing 
    to accept these files 
    <ul>
      <li>In a text editor, open the &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValuesComposerFieldAdded.arff&quot; 
        file we just saved</li>
      <li>In the text editor, find the line that says &quot;@attribute COMPOSER 
        string&quot;</li>
      <li>Replace this line with a line that says &quot;@attribute COMPOSER {NotJosquin,Josquin}&quot; 
        <ul>
          <li>If you were using other potential labels than &quot;NotJosquin&quot; 
            and &quot;Josquin&quot;, then you would have to include them here</li>
          <li>These labels <em>must</em> match exactly the labels that are used 
            in your training data 
            <ul>
              <li>Even though you do not need to generate an ARFF file for your 
                training data (you can just use the CSV file you already saved), 
                it can be useful to save one anyway and copy its relevant &quot;@attribute 
                . . . &quot; line for its candidate classes to your test pieces 
                ARFF file</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This step is necessary for Weka to know what possible classes (composers, 
        in this case) each of the pieces could have</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Normally Weka would know implicitly from the file model composer labels 
          if they were included, but we marked these ones with &quot;?&quot; earlier 
          because the truth is unknown</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Save the file as &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValuesComposerHeaderAdjusted.arff&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SAVING AND TRAINING A CLASSIFICATION MODEL</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are now ready to train and save a classification model</li>
  <li>In Weka's <em>Preprocess </em>tab, click the <em>Open file </em>button 
    <ul>
      <li>Open the &quot;JosquinNotJosquinFeatureValuesWekaReady.csv&quot; file</li>
      <li>Go to Weka's <em>Classify </em>tab</li>
      <li>In the <em>Classifier </em>area, press the <em>Choose </em>button 
        <ul>
          <li>Select <em>weka &gt; classifiers &gt; functions &gt; SMO</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We can do a quick cross-validation test (as we did in previous sections 
    of this tutorial) to make sure that this data reasonably separates pieces 
    by Josquin from pieces not by Josquin 
    <ul>
      <li>In the <em>Test options </em>area, make sure <em>Cross-validation</em> 
        is selected</li>
      <li>Press the <em>Start </em>button</li>
      <li>You should get an average classification accuracy of around 95%</li>
      <li>If so, we are happy, since this data does a good job at doing what we 
        want it to</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now let's actually train and save a model 
    <ul>
      <li>In the <em>Test options </em>area, select <em>Use training set</em></li>
      <li>Press the <em>Start </em>button</li>
      <li>You will see an even higher classification accuracy than before 
        <ul>
          <li>This is meaningless, since we just classified the training data 
            itself</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What is important is that we now have a model ready to classify other 
        separate test data </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Save the model you just trained 
    <ul>
      <li>In the <em>Results list </em> area, tight-click on the <em>last </em>entry 
        there and select <em>Save model</em></li>
      <li>Save it as &quot;JosquinNotJosquinTrainedModel.model&quot;</li>
      <li>We do not have to save it to use it, but it is good to keep a record 
        of it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>USING OUR TRAINED MODEL TO CLASSIFY TEST PIECES</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Now we are ready to classify our uncertain pieces using the classification 
    model we just trained</li>
  <li>In the <em>Test options </em>area, click on <em>Supplied test set, </em>and 
    then click the <em>Set</em> button next to it 
    <ul>
      <li>Click the <em>Open file </em>button in the dialog box that appears</li>
      <li>In the file chooser dialog that appears, choose <em>Arff data files 
        (*.arff)</em> from the <em>Files of Type </em>dropdown menu </li>
      <li>Select &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValuesComposerHeaderAdjusted.arff&quot;</li>
      <li>Press the <em>Open </em>button</li>
      <li>Press the <em>Close </em>button on the dialog box you then drop back 
        down to</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the <em>Test options </em>area, press the <em>More options </em>button 
    <ul>
      <li>Press the <em>Choose </em>button and select <em>Plain Text</em></li>
      <li>Press the <em>OK </em>button</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the <em>Results list </em> area, make sure that the <em>last </em>entry 
    is selected 
    <ul>
      <li>If you wanted to load an already saved model, you could right-click 
        on the white space of the <em>Results list</em> option and select <em>Load 
        model </em></li>
      <li>We do not need to open a saved model now, since we still have the one 
        we just trained already loaded</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Press the <em>Start </em>button 
    <ul>
      <li>This generates a big list of output data</li>
      <li>If you want, you can copy and paste it into a text editor, where it 
        can be saved, maybe as &quot;MaybeJosquinClassificationResults.txt&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the big list of output data that was generated, scroll up to where it 
    says &quot;=== Predictions on test set ===&quot;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This lists, for each piece, whether it was classified as being by Josquin 
      or NotJosquin</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The pieces are listed in the same order as in the 'MaybeJosquinFeatureValues.csv&quot; 
    file jSymbolic originally generated 
    <ul>
      <li>You can cross-reference the two to identify which piece is which 
        <ul>
          <li>This is necessary because Weka sadly does not keep track of external 
            instance identifiers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Note that there will be an offset of one row number between the number 
        in the list Weka generates and the row number in the &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValues.csv&quot; 
        file 
        <ul>
          <li>This is because the &quot;MaybeJosquinFeatureValues.csv&quot; file 
            has an extra row at the top specifying feature headings</li>
          <li>You can temporarily delete this feature heading row if you want 
            the two sets of row numbers to match</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you scroll down the list of classifications, you will see that, as we 
    go, fewer and fewer pieces are counted as being Josquin 
    <ul>
      <li>This makes sense, because the probability of a given piece actually 
        being by Josquin decreases as we go down the list, because they have less 
        secure attribution levels (according to Jesse Rodin)</li>
      <li>This is great news for Jesse Rodin, as it means that the patterns in 
        the music tend to correspond overall with the results of the historical 
        research that led him to specify these particular security levels 
        <ul>
          <li>Congratulations, Jesse!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This does not prove definitively which individual pieces really are by Josquin 
    and which are not, however 
    <ul>
      <li>We would need more training data from more diverse composers who are 
        not Josquin to do that</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It does, however, demonstrate and confirm a musicologically meaningful general 
    pattern
    <ul>
      <li>And it shows how historical musicological research and statistical research 
        using jSymbolic features and machine learning can mutually confirm or, 
        less pleasingly but arguably even more importantly, challenge each other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
