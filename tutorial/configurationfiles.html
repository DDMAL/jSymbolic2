<p><strong>THE CONFIGURATION FILE AND WINDOWING SETTINGS MANUAL</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>jSymbolic has special configuration files that you can use to 
    store settings and extraction jobs </li>
  <li>We will now look at these files in some detail, as they can be very useful:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>These files can keep an archive of experiments you perform for future 
      records </li>
    <li>They can be shared for the purpose of research verification / duplication 
    </li>
    <li>They can also be very useful for quickly running different variants of 
      an experiment</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <em>Configuration File and Windowing Settings Panel</em>, on the bottom 
    left of the jSymbolic GUI, includes: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The <em>Load New Settings from a Config File</em> button allows the user 
      to load a pre-saved set of selected features, input files, output paths 
      and windowing settings from a configuration file</li>
    <li>The <em>Save These Settings to a Config File </em>button allows the user 
      to save the currently entered set of selected features, input files, output 
      paths and windowing settings to a configuration file</li>
    <li>The <em>Extract Features from Entire Files </em>radio button setting causes 
      features to only be extracted from symbolic files in their entirety (i.e. 
      without windowing) 
      <ul>
        <li> We will focus on this kind of feature extraction in this demo, as 
          it tends to be the most useful</li>
        <li>Selecting this option will grey out the Window Duration and Window 
          Overlap text areas</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <em>Extract Features from Windows Radio Button</em> causes features 
      to be extracted from windows only (as opposed to extracting them from files 
      in their entirety) 
      <ul>
        <li>Each window will have a duration equal to the number of seconds specified 
          in the <em>Window Duration Text Area</em></li>
        <li>The windows will have a fractional overlap specified in the <em>Window 
          Overlap Fraction Text Area</em> 
          <ul>
            <li>A value of 0 indicates no overlap</li>
            <li>e.g. for a window duration value of 10 and a window overlap fraction 
              value of 0.1, the windows will be from 0 sec to 10 sec, 9 sec to 
              19 sec, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>We can return to windowed extraction later if we have time, but let's move 
    on for now</li>
  <li>Let's save the settings you entered into jSymbolic in the previous steps: 
    <ul>
      <li>Click the <em>Save These Settings to a Config File </em>button</li>
      <li>Navigate to inside the &quot;01_Comparing_Two_Files&quot; folder 
        <ul>
          <li>In the <em>File Name </em>field type &quot;MySimpleJosqOckConfigs.txt&quot;</li>
          <li>Press the <em>Save</em> button</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In your favorite text editor, open this config file that you just saved 
    <ul>
      <li>You will rarely look at config files manually in practice, but this 
        gives you an idea of what they look like</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let's now look at how you can load config files: 
    <ul>
      <li>Quit jSymbolic (press the exit box at the top right of the jSymbolic 
        window)
and rerun jSymbolic      
        <ul>
          <li>Note that you have lost the settings you entered previously</li>
          <li>This step is not strictly necessary, but is included here for the purpose of illustration</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <em>Load New Settings from a Config File </em>button</li>
      <li>Navigate to inside the &quot;01_Comparing_Two_Files&quot; folder 
        <ul>
          <li>Double click the &quot;MySimpleJosqOckConfigs.txt&quot; file that 
            you created</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <em>Yes </em>button in the warning dialog box that comes up</li>
      <li>Note that you have now recovered the settings you saved earlier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON CONFIGURATION FILES</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can also save configuration files without specifying input files or 
    output paths 
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. indicating only things like chosen features and windowing settings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you wish to always start up jSymbolic with a given set of default settings, 
    save the corresponding configuration file in the same folder as the &quot;jSymbolic2.jar&quot; 
    file, with the name &quot;jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt&quot;</li>
  <li>See the <a href="../manual/home.html" target="top">jSymbolic manual</a> for more information on how the configuration files work</li>
</ul>
