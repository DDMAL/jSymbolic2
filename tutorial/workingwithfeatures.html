<p><strong>THE FEATURE SELECTOR PANEL</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>Feature Selector Panel</em>, on the top right of the jSymbolic GUI, 
    includes: 
    <ul>
      <li>A table containing one row for each feature that jSymbolic can extract 
        <ul>
          <li> The first column contains check boxes allowing users to select 
            which features to save during feature extraction</li>
          <li>The second column indicates the name of the feature</li>
          <li>The third column indicates the unique code of the feature 
            <ul>
              <li>e.g. &quot;P-3&quot; indicates the third basic pitch feature</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The fourth column indicates the number of values the feature has 
            <ul>
              <li>Some features are multi-dimensional (mostly histograms)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The fifth column indicates whether the feature may only be extracted 
            from MEI (i.e. not MIDI) files</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Select Default Features </em>button selects the features loaded 
        in the last config file</li>
      <li>The <em>Select All Features </em>button selects all of the features</li>
      <li>The <em>Deselect All Features </em>button deselects all of the features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Double clicking any of the features will bring up some additional information 
    about it, including: 
    <ul>
      <li>A brief description of it</li>
      <li>Whether it may be extracted from overlapping windows of a file as well 
        as from files as a whole, or only from files as a whole</li>
      <li>Whether its calculation uses the values of any other features 
        <ul>
          <li>You don't need to worry about this in practice, since jSymbolic 
            is smart enough to calculate necessary dependent features in the background 
            even if you have not selected these dependencies to be saved</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let's start with a very simple set of features: 
    <ul>
      <li>Press the <em>Deselect All Features </em>button</li>
      <li>Check the <em>Range (P-8) </em>feature</li>
      <li>Check the <em>Most Common Pitch (P-16) </em>feature</li>
      <li>Check the <em>Most Common Pitch Class (P-17) </em>feature</li>
      <li>This means that only three features are now set to be extracted 
        <ul>
          <li>Normally we will extract far more, but this is a nice simple example 
            for pedagogical purposes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Please see the &quot;Feature Explanations&quot; section of the <a href="../manual/home.html" target="top">jSymbolic manual</a> for more information on how each feature is defined</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND SAVING SETTINGS PANEL</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>Feature Extraction and Saving Settings Panel</em>, on the bottom 
    right of the jSymbolic GUI, includes: 
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>Set ACE XML Feature Values Save Path </em>button allows the 
        user to specify the path to which feature values will be saved 
        <ul>
          <li>A save path can also be typed in directly</li>
          <li>This path specifies where the ACE XML feature values file will be 
            saved 
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;ACE XML&quot; is a set of special output file formats 
                used by jSymbolic and the other jMIR components</li>
              <li>This ACE XML file is always saved, even if feature values are 
                also saved as Weka ARFF or CSV files (see below)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Set ACE XML Feature Definitions Save Path </em>button allows 
        the user to specify the path to which feature definitions will be saved 
        <ul>
          <li>A save path can also be typed in directly</li>
          <li>This path specifies where the ACE XML feature definitions file will 
            be saved 
            <ul>
              <li>Unlike the ACE XML feature values file, this file does <em>not</em> 
                hold any feature values 
                <ul>
                  <li>Instead, it holds descriptions and other metadata about 
                    the features </li>
                  <li>This is useful for the purpose of archiving and sharing 
                    feature extraction information</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Auto Save Features in a Weka ARFF File </em>check box allows 
        users to also (i.e. in addition to the ACE XML feature values file) save 
        features in an ARFF file 
        <ul>
          <li>ARFF files are used by the Weka data mining software</li>
          <li>The ARFF file will be saved in the same directory and with the same 
            file name as the specified ACE XML feature values file, but with a 
            different file extension</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Auto Save Features in a CSV File </em>check box allows users 
        to also (i.e. in addition to the ACE XML feature values file) save features 
        in a CSV file 
        <ul>
          <li>CSV files are a common format used by spreadsheets, Weka and many 
            other programs 
            <ul>
              <li>They are essentially just comma-delimited text files</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The CSV file will be saved in the same directory and with the same 
            file name as the specified ACE XML feature values file, but with a 
            different file extension</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>EXTRACT AND SAVE FEATURES </em>button begins an actual feature 
        extraction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let's do a simple feature extraction from the two files we selected and 
    of the three features we selected in the previous steps 
    <ul>
      <li>Press the <em>Set ACE XML Feature Values Save Path </em>button and navigate 
        to inside the &quot;01_Comparing_Two_Files&quot; folder 
        <ul>
          <li>In the <em>File Name </em>field type &quot;MyJosqOckSimpleFeatureValues.xml&quot;</li>
          <li>Press the <em>Save</em> button</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Press the <em>Set ACE XML Feature Definitions Save Path </em>button 
        and navigate to inside the &quot;01_Comparing_Two_Files&quot; folder (you 
        will probably already be there) 
        <ul>
          <li>In the <em>File Name </em>field type &quot;MySimpleFeatureDefinitions.xml&quot;</li>
          <li>Press the <em>Save</em> button</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Leave the <em>Auto Save Features in a Weka ARFF File</em> and <em>Auto 
        Save Features in a CSV File</em> boxes checked</li>
      <li>Press the <em>EXTRACT AND SAVE FEATURES </em>button 
        <ul>
          <li>Wait a few moments while the feature values are extracted</li>
          <li>Note that updates are posted to the <em>Processing Information Panel 
            </em>as processing progresses</li>
          <li>Wait until a dialog box pops up telling you that processing is complete, 
            and then press the <em>OK </em>button</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
