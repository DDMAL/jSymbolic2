<p><strong>TAKING A FIRST LOOK AT THE JSYMBOLIC INSTALL</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The jSymbolic folder you just downloaded and unzipped holds the jSymbolic software, which you will be learning and working 
    with </li>
  <li>The folders contained in the &quot;jSymbolicTutorialWorkingFiles.zip&quot; file you downloaded include various data, 
    configuration, feature and other files that we will be working with soon 
    <ul>
      <li>More about those later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open the jSymbolic folder you downloaded and unzipped
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;jSymbolic2.jar&quot; is the jSymbolic program</li>
      <li>&quot;lib&quot; is a set of code libraries used by jSymbolic 
        <ul>
          <li>You do not need to worry about these</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt&quot; contains the default settings jSymbolic 
        starts with 
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. features to extract, windowing settings, input files, output 
            save paths, etc.</li>
          <li>Later we will look at how to generate and use your own specialized 
            jSymbolic configuration files</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>&quot;README.md&quot; is provides a basic introduction to jSymbolic</li>
      <li>&quot;manual&quot; holds jSymbolic's detailed manual</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open the &quot;manual&quot; sub-folder 
    <ul>
      <li>Double click on the &quot;home.html&quot; file in this sub-folder to open the manual</li>
      <li>Take particular note of the &quot;Feature Explanations&quot; section, 
        which provides explanations on each of the features jSymbolic extracts</li>
      <li>We will cover many important highlights in this tutorial, but the manual 
        will provide an important reference for further details</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RUNNING JSYMBOLIC BY DOUBLE CLICKING ON IT</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Go back to the main jSymbolic folder (the one that holds &quot;jSymbolic2.jar&quot;</li>
  <li>The easiest way to run jSymbolic is to just double click on &quot;jSymbolic.jar&quot;, 
    which will bring up the jSymbolic GUI
    <ul>
      <li>Try double clicking it</li>
      <li>If Java is not installed on your computer, then this will not work 
        <ul>
          <li>See the <a href="installation.html" target="right">installation 
            instructions</a> we saw previously on how to install Java</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If your computer asks you to authorize jSymbolic, or says that you do 
        not have permission to run it, then authorize it
        <ul>
          <li>See the <a href="installation.html" target="right">installation 
            instructions</a> for details on how to do this</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RUNNING JSYMBOLIC FROM THE TERMINAL / COMMAND LINE</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Although double clicking on the jSymbolic2.jar file is almost always a perfectly fine 
    way to start jSymbolic, this method of running jSymbolic may in rare occasions cause problems
    <ul>
      <li>Since  Java may not allocate enough memory for it process very large files</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let's try running jSymbolic a different way, just to be safe
    <ul>
      <li>Although, as noted above, it is usually absolutely fine to run it simply by double clicking it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If jSymbolic is still open from the steps above, close it by pressing the exit box at the top right of the jSymbolic 
    window </li>
  <li>We will now run jSymbolic from the command line 
    <ul>
      <li>This allows us to instruct Java to give jSymbolic more memory if it 
        needs it</li>
      <li>It is also possible to use  jSymbolic's dedicated command line interface (as opposed to its graphical user interface, which this tutorial focuses on), which 
        can be a faster way of using the software once you get used to it
        <ul>
          <li>See the manual for more details on this way of using jSymbolic</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open a text terminal on your computer and move to the jSymbolic directory 
    in it: 
    <ul>
      <li>Windows: 
        <ul>
          <li>Press the windows button to allow you to open the search interface</li>
          <li> Type &quot;cmd&quot; and press enter to spawn a terminal window 
          </li>
          <li>Type &quot;cd <em>the_path_of_the_jSymbolic_folder_you_downloaded_that_contains_the_jSymbolic2.jar_file</em>&quot; in the terminal 
            and press enter to move to this folder</li>
          <li> Type &quot;dir&quot; to see the files that are there and to make 
            sure you are in the right place</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Macintosh: 
        <ul>
          <li>Press command-spacebar to allow you to open the search interface</li>
          <li> Type &quot;terminal&quot; and press enter to spawn run a terminal 
            window </li>
          <li>Type &quot;cd <em>the_path_of_the_jSymbolic_folder_you_downloaded_that_contains_the_jSymbolic2.jar_file</em>&quot; in the terminal 
            and press enter to move to this folder</li>
          <li> Type &quot;ls&quot; to see the files that are there and to make 
            sure you are in the right place</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run the jSymbolic GUI in this terminal window (making sure that you moved 
    into the jSymbolic folder you downloaded (the one containing &quot;jSymbolic2.jar&quot;) in the terminal, as described 
    above) 
    <ul>
      <li> Type &quot;java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar&quot; to run jSymbolic</li>
      <li>You will see the same jSymbolic window as you did before when you double 
        clicked on &quot;jSymbolic2.jar&quot;, but you have now given Java permission 
        to assign jSymbolic much more memory if it needs it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Leave this window open for the next steps</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Congratulations, you have now got most of the infrastructural set-up work done. 
  Now let's dive into actually using jSymbolic <a href="jsymbolicbasics.html" target="right">.
