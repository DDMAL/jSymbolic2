<p><strong>LOOKING AT DATA FROM THE THE ANATOMY OF LATE 15TH- AND EARLY 16TH-CENTURY 
  IBERIAN POLYPHONIC MUSIC PROJECT</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dr. Jo&atilde;o Pedro d’Alvarenga has kindly provided  samples of 
    the music associated with a <a href="https://iberianpolyphonicmusic.wordpress.com" target="top">very 
    interesting project</a> his research group is working on 
    <ul>
      <li>This music is found in the &quot;04_Iberian_Data&quot; folder in the 
        &quot;jSymbolicTutorialWorkingFiles.zip&quot; file you downloaded earlier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This data provides an excellent opportunity to review what we have learned 
    and to explore data that is particularly relevant to the context of this tutorial</li>
  <li>It is suggested that you once again use the provided &quot;FeaturesThatAvoidBiasInRenMusictConfigs.txt&quot; feature subset</li>
  <li> Please load some of these files into jSymbolic and run a feature extraction 
    <ul>
      <li>You may wish to start with a subset of the files, depending on the time 
        available</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once feature extraction is complete, please explore the extracted features 
    in Weka 
    <ul>
      <li>But do not forget to label the music using a spreadsheet first! 
        <ul>
          <li>And you may need to be careful about certain non-ASCII characters 
            in the class labels, as Weka can be fussy about some of these </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Things to experiment with in Weka:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Manual examination of feature values in Excel (or some other spreadsheet)</li>
    <li>Manual examination of feature histograms in Weka</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Manual examination of feature scatterplots in Weka</li>
    <li>Automatic feature selection</li>
    <li>Machine learning 
      <ul>
        <li> Weka can use the jSymbolic features to distinguish between the four 
          groups of music about 85% of the time under cross-validation, with 
          just default settings 
          <ul>
            <li>It does tend to confuse the Penalosa (secular) as Penalosa (sacred), 
              however, which is actually a musicologically reasonable result</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You can also try separating out your own training and testing sets, 
          and seeing how individual pieces are actually classified 
          <ul>
            <li>Try to keep an equally balanced level of music in each category 
              in the training set and in the testing set</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>What would you like to know about this music? 
    <ul>
      <li>What kinds of things would you like the features to reveal?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
