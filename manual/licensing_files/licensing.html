<p> <strong>LIBRARIES USED BY JSYMBOLIC</strong></p>

<p> The following Java .jar files serve as jSymbolic libraries, and are packaged with jSymbolic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ACE:</strong> A metalearning tool. jSymbolic uses it to save ACE XML files. Like jSymbolic, ACE is part of the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/" target="top">jMIR</a> framework.</li>
  <li><strong>UtilityClasses:</strong> A set of utility classes providing a variety of general-purpose functionality. jSymbolic uses it to perform miscellaneous tasks, especially those relating to parsing audio files. Like jSymbolic, these are part of the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/" target="top">jMIR</a> framework.</li>
  <li><strong>jMei2Midi:</strong> Conversion software that converts MEI data to MIDI data. This includes an MEI pipeline which can extract and preserve MEI-specific features that would be lost in the conversion to MIDI. The software can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/jMei2Midi" target="top">jMei2Midi page</a> as a <a href="https://maven.apache.org/" target="top">Maven project</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p>

<p> I would like to thank the many individuals and organizations who took part in the creation of the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/" target="top">jMIR</a> framework in general. Tristano Tenaglia deserves special credit for his extensive work co-writing many parts of version 2 of jSymbolic with me, and he was solely responsible for implementing the jMei2Midi MEI parsing functionality. Dr. Ichiro Fujinaga also played a key role as my Ph.D. supervisor during the development of the first version of this software, and he, Dr. Julie E. Cumming, and my other SIMSSA co-investigators also later made important contributions during the work associated with the <a href="https://simssa.ca" target="top">SIMSSA</a> (Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis) project. I would also like to thank the <a href="http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/" target="top">FRQSC</a> (Fonds de recherche Société et culture du Québec) and <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx" target="top">SSHRC</a> (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) for their very generous funding.</p>
