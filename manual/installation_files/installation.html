<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>

<p>This section of the manual describes how to access and install jSymbolic onto one's computer, and includes an outline of some of the files and resources included with the jSymbolic distribution package.</p>

<p> <strong>COMPATIBILITY</strong></p>

<p>The jSymbolic software is written in <a href="http://www.java.com/" target="top">Java</a>, which means that it can in principle be run on any system that has the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on it. It is particularly recommended that this software be used with Linux, as it was developed and tested primarily under this operating systems. Although the software should still run perfectly well on Windows, OS X, Solaris or any other operating system with the JRE installed on it, users should be advised that jSymbolic has not yet been fully tested on these platforms, so difficulties may be encountered.</p>

<p>This software was developed with version 8 of the JDK (Java Development Kit) and because it uses features from Java 8, it is required that users have Java 8 or newer installed on their systems in order to run jSymbolic properly.</p>

<p> <strong>INSTALLING THE JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>

<p>If your system already has the JRE installed, as will most typically be the case, you may skip this section. If not, you will need to install the JRE in order to run jSymbolic. The JRE can be downloaded for free from the <a href="http://www.java.com/" target="top">Java</a> web site. The JDK typically includes the JRE, or the JRE can simply be installed alone.</p>

<p>When the JRE download is complete, follow the installation instructions that come with it in order to install it.</p>

<p><strong>INSTALLING JSYMBOLIC</strong></p>

<p>The jSymbolic software is available at <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/" target="top">jmir.sourceforge.net</a>. It is delivered in a zipped file, from which jSymbolic can be extracted using any of a variety of dearchiving utilities (e.g. ZipGenius).</p>

<p>There are two versions of jSymbolic, namely the development version and the user version. The user version contains everything needed to run jSymbolic, but does not include any source code. The developer version does include source code.</p>

<p>The user version unzips into a single directory. Installation simply involves extracting this directory to any desired disk location. See the sections of the manual on the <a href="../commandline_files/commandline.html">command line interface</a> and the <a href="../gui_files/gui.html">GUI</a> for information on running the program. A file entitled Manual.html is among the files extracted, and it provides useful information about the software.</p>

<p>The developer version presents jSymbolic in the form of a NetBeans project. Four directories are contained in the zipped distribution file:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ACE:</strong> A metalearning tool. jSymbolic uses it to save ACE XML files. A NetBeans project that includes source code.</li>
  <li><strong>jMei2Midi:</strong> Conversion software that converts MEI data to MIDI data. This includes an MEI pipeline which can extract and preserve MEI-specific features that would be lost in the conversion to MIDI.</li>
  <li><strong>jSymbolic:</strong> The jSymbolic source files, as well as other NetBeans project documents and general documentation.</li>
  <li> <strong>ThirdPartyJars: </strong>Contains the distributable third party software used by jSymbolic and its associated jMIR projects.</li>
  <li><strong> UtilityClasses: </strong>A NetBeans project holding general jMIR classes used by jSymbolic, including source code.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>RUNNING JSYMBOLIC</strong></p>

<p>Once the installation instructions provided above have been completed, the user may then run jSymbolic. Instructions on how to run jSymbolic are included in the sections of the manual on the <a href="../commandline_files/commandline.html">command line interface</a> and the <a href="../gui_files/gui.html">GUI</a>.</p>
