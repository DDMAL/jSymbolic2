<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>

<p>This section of the manual explains all of the command line arguments that may be used with jSymbolic and provides usage examples.</p>

<p><strong>RUNNING JSYMBOLIC GRAPHICALLY</strong></p>

<p>The simplest way of using jSymbolic is to simply run the jSymbolic <a href="../gui_files/gui.html">GUI</a> by double clicking the jSymbolic2.jar file's icon on a graphical disk interface, such as Windows or OS X. However, a greater range of options are made available by running jSymbolic through a terminal interface using command line arguments, as described below. Also, running jSymbolic simply by double clicking its icon could, in rare cases, result in running out of memory in the case of particularly large and complex files (see below), so in such cases it may be safer to run jSymbolic from the command line.</p>

<p><strong>ACCESSING JSYMBOLIC VIA A TERMINAL INTERFACE</strong></p>

<p>One way of using jSymbolic is via a terminal prompt, such as a Windows DOS command prompt, or a terminal prompt on OS X, Linux, UNIX, etc. Although such a command line approach can be less intuitive for some initially relative to using the jSymbolic GUI, it can also sometimes be faster and easier. If you are unsure how to access a terminal prompt on your computer, please consult instructions for your particular operating system on-line for details on how to access and use it.</p>

<p>Once you have accessed a terminal prompt, navigate to the jSymbolic folder and locate the file named "jSymbolic2.jar", which is included in the jSymbolic distribution. A folder called &quot;lib&quot; should also be present in the same folder (it contains other .jar files jSymbolic needs to run properly). You must run this "jSymbolic2.jar" file (using the Java Runtime Environment), as shown below, in order to access jSymbolic's functionality. The particular command line arguments that you use when running jSymbolic in this way will determine exactly what jSymbolic does.</p>
<p><strong>COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS THAT INCLUDE ONE OR MORE SPACES</strong></p>
<p>Note that any command line arguments you use that contain a space (such as file paths) must be fully enclosed in quotation marks, otherwise jSymbolic will not work properly. This is standard Java practice. So, for example, if one were using jSymbolic with a configuration file (see below) called &quot;My Config File.txt&quot;, then this would NOT work:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -configrun My Config File.txt</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, correct usage would be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -configrun &quot;My Config File.txt&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>RUNNING JSYMBOLIC WITH A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH MEMORY CEILING</strong></p>
<p>By its nature, the Java Virtual Machine is always assigned a maximum amount of memory at runtime. If a specific maximum is not assigned manually at runtime, then this will be the smaller of 1/4 the computer's physical memory or 1 GB.
jSymbolic's processing can sometimes require quite
a bit of memory, so it is best to manually specify a large maximum when running jSymbolic just to be safe. This can be done by using the &quot;-Xmx&quot; flag when running Java, as shown in the examples below.</p>
<p>It is suggested that a maximum of six gigabytes be used, which is why &quot;-Xmx6g&quot; is specified below. Of course, the vast majority of processing jobs will require much, much less than this amount of memory, but it is suggested that a high maximum such as this be assigned if possible, as jSymbolic will quit processing (with an explanatory error message) if the maximum assigned memory is exceeded while processing a particularly large or complex piece of music.
In the very unlikely event that an out-of-memory error does occur, jSymbolic should be rerun with a larger maximum specified.</p>
<p>Users are advised not to assign a greater amount of memory greater than the amount of physical memory that they have on their systems, however, as virtual memory processing can be quite slow.
</p>
<p><strong>RUNNING JSYMBOLIC FROM A TERMINAL INTERFACE</strong></p>
The simplest way to run jSymbolic from a terminal prompt is to type the following at your terminal prompt (after you have navigated to the directory containing the jSymbolic2.jar file):

<blockquote>
  <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This will run the <a href="../gui_files/gui.html">jSymbolic GUI</a> set up with default settings.</p>

<p>One must add jSymbolic command line arguments if one wishes to instigate jSymbolic processing directly from the command line. Some of these command line arguments consist of flag/value pairs, where the flag comes first and is preceded with a "-". Essentially, the flag indicates the type of option, and the value indicates its particular setting.</p>

<p>Other command line arguments simply consist of values, with no flags, of flags with no values. For example, a lone flag of "-help" will print to the terminal a list of valid flags with explanations of what they are. This can be run as follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>java -jar jSymbolic2.jar -help</pre></blockquote>

<p>Invalid command line arguments will also result in the list of legitimate command line arguments being printed out to the terminal.</p>

<p><strong>Important General Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
	
  <li>The ordering of the command line arguments does matter in certain cases.</li>
  <li>jSymbolic's operation can also be governed by its <a href="../configuration_files/configuration.html">configuration settings file</a>, as explained further below.</li>
  <li>If the user does not specify a <a href="../configuration_files/configuration.html">configuration settings file</a> at runtime, then jSymboic will look for a default one in the same folder as the jSymbolic2.jar file, and with the file name <i>jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt</i>. If no such file exists, or if it is not a valid jSymbolic configuration settings file, then the jSymbolic will simply run with hard-coded default settings.
	
  <li>All file or directory paths specified in command line arguments must either be absolute or relative to the directory containing the jSymbolic2.jar file.</li>
  <li>All recursive directory searches for symbolic files (as mentioned below) will only return files that have valid .mid, .midi or .mei extensions (with any mix of upper-case or lower-case letters).</li>
  <li>Errors that occur during batch processing of multiple files will be logged to the terminal. Processing of other files will not be interrupted.</li>
  <li>jSymbolic can currently process the following kinds of symbolic music files: MIDI files and MEI files. Any files that cannot be parsed by jSymbolic will cause an error message to be generated.</li>
  <li>If an MEI-specific feature (e.g. Number of Grace Notes) is set to be extracted, then it will only be extracted from MEI files. It will be ignored by other files, such as MIDI files.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>SPEEDING UP PROCESSING BY EXTRACTING FEATURES IN PARALLEL WITH MULTIPLE INSTANCES</strong></p>
<p>Although it is not yet possible to run jSymbolic feature extraction using multiple 
  internal threads to speed up processing, if processing speed is a concern
then  multiple instances of  jSymbolic may be spawned from separate terminal windows, and each 
  such jSymbolic instance may be run in parallel without danger to extract features from 
  separate portions of a large dataset. This is rarely necessary in practice, however, since
  jSymbolic is generally quite fast when even just a single instance is used.</p>
<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC'S COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS (WITH NO NON-DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE SPECIFIED)</strong></p>

<ul>
	
  <li>
    <pre>java -jar jSymbolic2.jar -help</pre>
    <p>Outputs valid command line arguments.</li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar</pre>
    <p>Runs the jSymbolic GUI using default settings pre-loaded.</li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt</pre>
    <p>Extracts features using default settings from the symbolic music file as a whole at the path specified by <i>SymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath</i>, and saves the extracted features as an <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE XML 1.1</a> Features Values File to the path specified by <i>AceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath</i>. An ACE XML Feature Definitions File is also saved to the path specified by <i>AceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath</i>. Note that <i>SymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath</i> may alternatively be a directory, in which case jSymbolic extracts features from the symbolic music files with recognized extentions that it (and its recursively searched sub-directrories) contain. Since no <a href="../configuration_files/configuration.html">configuration settings file</a> is specified, jSymbolic first checks for a  configurations file in the jSymbolic home directory with the default <i>jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt</i> file name. If it exists, and it does not specify input or output paths, then feature extraction occurs under its settings. If it does not exist, or if it specifies input or output paths, then feature extraction occurs under default settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -window &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt &ltWindowLength&gt &ltWindowOverlapFraction&gt</pre>
    <p>Processing here is similar to the above case, but now the input file is broken into a series of windows, and features are extracted from each of these windows separately. Each window is of equal temporal duration except for the last, which will have a duration corrsponding to the amount of remaining time in the piece. The features extracted from each of these windows are stored separately in a single output ACEM XML Feature Values file. The <i>WindowLength</i> value specifies the duration of each window in seconds. The <i>WindowOverlapFraction</i> value (which should have a value of 0 (for no overlap) or above and below 1) specifies the amount of overlap between consecutive windows. For example, for a <i>WindowLength</i> value of 10 and a <i>WindowOverlapFraction</i> value of 0.1, the windows will be from 0 sec to 10 sec, 9 sec to 19 sec, etc. Since no <a href="../configuration_files/configuration.html">configuration settings file</a> is specified, feature extraction occurs under default settings (aside from windowing, of course). Note that under these settings, even if a valid default <i>jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt</i> file exists, it is still ignored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -arff &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -arff -window &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt &ltWindowLength&gt &ltWindowOverlapFraction&gt</pre>
    <p>The <i>-arff</i> switch can be added to save features as <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html" target="top">Weka ARFF</a> files (in addition to saving them as ACE XML files). The ARFF file is saved with the same name as the &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt file, but with the extension changed to ".arff". Note that this can be coupled with the <i>-csv</i> switch explained below as well. Note that under these settings, even if a valid default <i>jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt</i> file exists, it is still ignored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -csv &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -csv -window &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt &ltWindowLength&gt &ltWindowOverlapFraction&gt</pre>
    <p>The <i>-csv</i> switch can be added to save features as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" target="top">CSV</a> text files (in addition to saving them as ACE XML files). The CSV file is saved with the same name as the &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt file, but with the extension changed to ".csv". Note that this can be coupled with the <i>-arff</i> switch explained above as well. Note that under these settings, even if a valid default <i>jSymbolicDefaultConfigs.txt</i> file exists, it is still ignored.</p>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -consistencycheck &ltMidiOrMeiOrDirectoryPath&gt</pre>
    <p>Outputs reports on whether or not certain musical characteristics are consistent within and across all MIDI and MEI files with recognized extensions that are found within the specified directory (and its recursively searched sub-directories), both across the files as a group and internally within each file.  Files must have a proper MIDI or MEI file extension to be included in this processing. A single file may alternatively be specified, in which case that file will just be checked for self-consistency. Either way, MEI files are converted to MIDI as part of this processing. If multiple files are found, then the generated reports will include: a brief report on the contents of each file and its self-consistency; a summary of self-inconsistencies found in the files (e.g. multiple tempos in a single file); and a report of the inconsistencies found across files (e.g. different tempos found in different files). Note that this does not involve feature extraction; it is instead a tool for helping to avoid dataset bias and aid testing and debugging during feature development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -mididump &ltMidiOrMeiOrDirectoryPath&gt</pre>
    <p>Outputs reports about the specified MIDI or MEI file and each of the MIDI messages contained in it (MEI files are converted to MIDI as part of this processing). A directory may alternatively be specified, in which case the contents of each MIDI or MEI file with recognized extensions that  it (and its recursively searched sub-directories) contain  will be reported one-by-one. Files must have a proper MIDI or MEI file extension to be included in this processing. Reports include formatted and aggregated details of all relevant MIDI messages found in each file (or, in the case of MEI files, the MIDI messages corresponding to the contents of each such file). Note that this does not involve feature extraction; it is instead a tool for helping to avoid dataset bias and aid testing and debugging during feature development.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC'S COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS (WITH A NON-DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE SPECIFIED)</strong></p>

<p>The following command line arguments can be used together with a jSymbolic <a href="../configuration_files/configuration.html">configuration settings file</a>:</p>

<ul>
	
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -configgui &ltConfigurationFilePath&gt</pre>
    <p>Runs the jSybmolic GUI with settings specified by the configuration file at the path specified by the <i>ConfigurationFilePath</i> value. An error message is printed to the terminal and execution terminated if this file is invalid or does not exist.</p>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -configrun &ltConfigurationFilePath&gt</pre>
    <p>Runs jSymbolic directly (does not run the GUI) using the settings specified by the configuration file at the path specified by the <i>ConfigurationFilePath</i> value. This configuration file must specify the input and output paths to use. An error message is printed to the terminal and execution terminated if this file is invalid or does not exist.</p>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -configrun &ltConfigurationFilePath&gt &ltSymbolicMusicFileOrDirectoryInputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureValuesOutputPath&gt &ltAceXmlFeatureDefinitionsOutputPath&gt</pre>
    <p>As in the above example, runs jSymbolic directly (does not run the GUI) using the settings specified by the configuration file at the path specified by the <i>ConfigurationFilePath</i> value. However, unlike the above example, the input and output paths must not be specified in the configuration settings file, and are instead specified directly in the provided command line arguments. An error message is printed to the terminal and execution terminated if this file is invalid or does not exist.</p>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -validateconfigallheaders &ltConfigurationFilePath&gt</pre>
    <p>Check the configuration file at the specified <i>ConfigurationFilePath</i> path to see if it is valid and complete. In this case, it must specify both output files and input files in order to be considered valid. Results are output to the terminal.</p>
  <li>
    <pre>java -Xmx6g -jar jSymbolic2.jar -validateconfigfeatureoption &ltConfigurationFilePath&gt</pre>
    <p>Check the configuration file at the specified <i>ConfigurationFilePath</i> path to see if it is valid and complete. In this case, it may specify neither output files nor input files in order to be considered valid. Results are output to the terminal.</p>
</ul>

<p><strong>USAGE EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<p>These examples demonstrate a few sample ways that jSymbolic can be run from the command line. These examples all make use of the command line flags and values explained above.</p>
