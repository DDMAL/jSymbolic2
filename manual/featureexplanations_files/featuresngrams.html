<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>
<p>The features belonging to the jSymbolic feature groups described in other parts of this manual largely focus on descriptors of musical content that are globally aggregated across the music from which features are being extracted, in a way that (in most cases) ignores the particular sequence that musical events occur. For example, the <a href="../featureexplanations_files/featuresmelodicintervals.html">melody and melodic interval features</a> mostly look at melodic transitions from one note to the next without regard to where and in what sequence these transitions occur relative to one another. This is not at all a bad thing, as such global features can be very helpful in capturing meaningful and important summary information about music; in a sense, it allows us to see the forest rather than focusing on the trees. Of course, it can also obviously be important focus on the trees as well, by also extracting features that capture more local information that encapsulates sequence. However, even features of this latter type still need to ultimately be representable as  simple and consistently formulated single values or vectors of related values that describe the music in an aggregated way,  as this is the nature of features. <strong>N-grams</strong> provide a convenient, meaningful and consistent way of capturing information about local sequences of musical events; features summarizing this information can then be calculated from n-grams.</p>
<p>In order to understand what an n-gram is, it is first necessary to understand the concept of a <strong>note onset slice</strong>, which provides a necessary mechanism for calculating n-grams. A note onset slice can defined as a vertical group of pitches sounding simultaneously, where a new slice is created whenever a new note attack occurs. Figure 1  demonstrates how slices are divided. In the case of jSymbolic note onset slices, unpitched (MIDI Channel 10) notes are ignored in the calculation of note onset slices and all the n-grams calculated from them.</p>
<p><img src="NoteOnsetSliceExample.jpg" border></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Non-metrical example of how note onset slices (indicated by broken vertical lines) are segmented.</p>
<p>Most note onset slice implementations, including those used in jSymbolic n-gram calculations (unless otherwise noted in individual cases), include not only pitches that coincide with the start of the slice, but also notes sustained from previous slices. So, in the example shown in Figure 1, the tied E4 in the upper voice would be found in both the slice it begins in and the two slices following it (since it is sustained in these slices). These three slices would thus be: [A3,E4], [F3,E4] and [G3,E4]. Note that the A3 in this first slice is sustained from the previous slice, and the  G3 in this third slice would also be included in the two slices following it. </p>
<p>Note onset slices can be extracted across all voices, as in the example above, but they can also be extracted separately for individual musical parts/voices. A part-segmented approach can be useful for capturing certain kinds of melodic or rhythmic information, while an approach considering all parts combined can be best for  capturing certain kinds of harmonic information. It should also be noted that individual parts can themselves each contain more than one simultaneous note (e.g. guitar or piano parts), so it can also sometimes be useful to only consider onsets corresponding to the highest (or lowest, depending on the analytical purpose) pitch sounding in a given part, while other times it is better to consider all pitches for the part. In order to increase flexibility and the variety of n-grams and features that can be used, jSymbolic permits music to be broken into multiple different kinds of note onset slices. Please see the jSymbolic code and its documentation for more details.</p>
<p>An interesting property of note onset slices, or at least their most common 
  varieties, is that they are not weighted by duration. So for example, a slice 
  holding three complete whole notes is treated identically during analysis to 
  a slice holding three complete half notes. In effect, note duration is only 
  relevant in determining whether a given note is found in multiple slices or 
  just the one it starts in. This can be a desirable property for many of the 
  features described below. However, in some cases it may be preferable to filter 
  out notes whose duration is too short, such as in cases where one does not want 
  brief decorative notes to influence harmonic transitions encoded in note onset 
  slices. It is therefore possible, if one wishes, to use note onset slice variants 
  that filter out notes with rhythmic values shorter than some given threshold 
  (e.g. smaller than an eighth note) if this would be desirable for calculating 
  a given type of feature. This is not, however, the default option under jSymbolic; 
  we have taken the position that it is generally better to include all pitched 
  notes in note onset slices, as the choice of filtering threshold can be arbitrary, 
  and even decorations can potentially be meaningful for certain kinds of features. 
  It is certainly possible to design future features based on note onset slices 
  that do in fact filter out very short notes, however.</p>
<p>In the case of music encoded as MIDI, notes that should in theory be encoded 
  as having simultaneous onsets may in fact include slight time offsets between 
  their attacks, either due to non-simultaneous onsets during a transcribed human 
  MIDI performance or due to encodings by score editing software intended to make 
  the music sound more performance-realistic when synthesized. It is therefore 
  necessary to time-quantize both note onsets and offsets, in order to make sure 
  that theoretically simultaneous note attacks do not result in two different 
  slices and to ensure that notes are not accidentally sustained to subsequent 
  slices in which they should in theory no longer be sounding, respectively. This 
  is exactly what jSymbolic does: when it encounters a new note onset, it jumps 
  to the next idealized sub-beat that corresponds to a 32nd note division (if 
  it is not already at one), and performs a look-behind and a look-ahead, each 
  with an idealized 32nd note's duration. All notes whose onsets fall in this 
  range are added to the note onset slice that is created for the original note 
  onset at the idealized 32nd note sub-beat. The consequence of this is that a 
  new note onset is automatically grouped into the same note onset slice of all 
  other new notes whose onsets fall within a 32nd note's range of it. It should 
  be noted that this 32nd note threshold was chosen as a compromoise based on 
  empirical analysis of MIDI files found on-line, and cannot by universably applicable; 
  MIDI files can still potentially be encoded through live performance with rhythmic 
  looseness effectively beyond this threshold, leading to notes that are annotated 
  on the score as being simultaneous ultimately being placed in two different 
  note onset slices.</p>
<p>Now that we have defined note onset slices, an <strong>n-gram</strong> can 
  be understood as information extracted from a contiguous sequence of either 
  <em>n</em> or <em>n+1</em> note onset slices, such that the n-gram encodes <em>n</em> 
  musical events or transitions in this sequence. An n-gram will require <em>n 
  </em>slices if it encodes events, and <em>n+1</em> slices if it encodes transitions. 
  One can imagine a wide variety of meaningful sequences that n-grams can be used 
  to encode.</p>
<p><img src="NgramExample.jpg" border="1"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Example of a vertical 3-gram and two horizontal/melodic 2-grams, where in this case indicated intervals are diatonic (unlike the typical jSymbolic case, where intervals are represented as semitone counts).</p>
<p>Figure 2  illustrates how n-grams of different types can be calculated. We can begin by noting that this musical example consists of three note onset slices: [D3,C4], [D3,B3] and [C3,C4]. From this, we can construct an n-gram consisting of the diatonic vertical intervals between the pitches in each slice: [7,6,8]. This type of n-gram is called a 3-gram, since it consists of three pieces of information (i.e. <em>n=3</em>). In  practice jSymbolic intervals are usually expressed as semitone counts rather than as diatonic intervals, so this vertical 3-gram could alternatively be expressed using this encoding format as [10,9,12].</p>
<p>One could also extract two melodic 2-grams from the example in Figure 2, one 
  for the upper part and one for the lower part, respectively: [-2,2] and [1,-2]. 
  In this case, diatonic melodic intervals are used in the encoding, with a negative 
  number indicating a descending interval. Note that the &quot;1&quot; in the lower 
  part 2-gram is used to indicate no melodic transition, since the D3 is held 
  in the second note onset slice. In practice, jSymbolic would also encode these 
  two melodic 2-grams as semitone counts, as follows: [-1,1] and [0,-2], for the 
  upper and lower parts respectively (the 0 in the lower voice melodic 2-gram 
  is now used to represent the held D3, since there is a transition of 0 semitones). 
</p>
<p>One could even combine these vertical 3-grams and melodic 2-grams into a single <strong>contrapuntal 3-gram</strong> encapsulating all this information (diatonically, in this encoding): [7(1,-2),6(-2 2),8]. This type of n-gram is not currently used by any jSymbolic features, but could serve as the basis for the development of future features.</p>
<p>Although n-grams of these types and others (e.g. rhythmic value n-grams, as described below) can encapsulate a wide variety of different kinds of musically meaningful information, it is difficult to use n-grams directly as features, partly because some contain entries of variable size (such as vertical n-grams), partly  because there can be a huge variety of different n-grams for any given piece and partly because there can also be substantial n-gram differences between different pieces. However, n-grams for a piece of music can be aggregated together into histograms and other intermediate data structures, which can in turn serve as the basis for calculating features that themselves in effect capture information about sequences of musical events.  Aggregating 
  n-grams in this way allows one to observe patterns in the music and quantify how frequently 
  different patterns occur, for example.</p>
<p>jSymbolic does exactly this: it calculates n-grams  from individual overlapping sliding windows of note onset slices, and then combines the resulting n-grams to generate histograms and other intermediate representations, from which features can be calculated. The jSymbolic features derived from n-grams can be divided into three types, each of which is catalogued below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../featureexplanations_files/featuresngrams.html#MelodicIntervalNgramFeatures">Melodic interval n-gram features</a></li>
  <li><a href="../featureexplanations_files/featuresngrams.html#VerticalIntervalNgramFeatures">Vertical interval n-gram features</a></li>
  <li><a href="../featureexplanations_files/featuresngrams.html#RhythmicValueNgramFeatures">Rhythmic value n-gram features</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Different types of note onset slices and associated n-grams are used for calculating different types of features. More details are provided in each of the sections below.</p>
<p>It should  be noted that jSymbolic includes implemented functionality for calculating a variety of note onset slices and n-gram types beyond just those described here. This is intended to facilitate the development of future features that may be based on them; although this code is not currently set to be executed by default (in order to save processing time), it can easily be accessed by those wishing to extend the jSymbolic feature catalogue. Please see the jSymbolic code and its documentation for more details on the complete catalogue of note onset slices and n-grams that can be extracted by jSymbolic.</p>
<p> jSymbolic also allows arbitrary values of <em>n </em>to be used when calculating n-grams, and also allows n-grams of potentially different sizes to be used in new features if desired. The implemented jSymbolic n-gram feature catalogue has generally focused on features where <em>n=3</em>, however, since they seem to produce the most useful information: 2-grams capture sequences that are too limited in length to be as musically meaningful as 3-grams, and n-grams with <em>n&gt;3</em> tend to produce so many different permutations that it can be difficult to extract practically usable feature information from them. 3-grams also seem to nicely correspond to certain musically important types of events, such as simple cadential patterns. That being said, future development could certainly be performed that utilizes larger n-grams of particular interest.</p>
<p>As a final note, it should be re-emphasized that MIDI Channel 10 unpitched percussion notes are excluded from all jSymbolic note onset slices and  n-grams including, of course, those described in the following sections.</p>

<a name="MelodicIntervalNgramFeatures"></a>
<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (MELODIC INTERVAL N-GRAMS SECTION)</strong></p>

<p> A <strong>melodic interval n-gram</strong> consists of a set of <em>n</em> values,  where each value 
  specifies the interval of a melodic transition in a musical line, and can be expressed as a count of semitones (with 0 indicating a melodic unison), or as a generic interval value. Each melodic 
  interval n-gram  corresponds to <em>n+1 </em>sequential note onset slices. Melodic n-grams (and 
  their associated note onset slices) are first calculated independently for each musical
part/voice (i.e. for each MIDI track/channel pairing), and the resulting n-grams  are 
  then all aggregated together into one collection for all lines just before features are calculated. If there are multiple notes in 
  a given note onset slice for a given line, then only the highest pitch in the 
  line's slice is included in the calculation of the melodic interval n-gram. Pitches still held in a given note onset slice from a previous  slice 
   are included in the set of candidate pitches in the new note 
  onset slice, and new note onset 
  slices are only considered to occur in the calculation of this particular type of n-gram if new notes in 
  a line's slice are higher in pitch than any still-sounding notes from one of the line's previous 
  slices.  Melodic n-grams are calculated using sequential sliding windows, with one 
  n-gram for each note onset slice that has <em>n</em> note onset slices following 
  it.</p>

<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (VERTICAL INTERVAL N-GRAMS SECTION)</strong></p>

<p> The  features in this section are based on two different types of vertical interval n-grams. Both types of vertical interval n-grams are calculated in sequential sliding windows, with one 
  n-gram for each note note onset slice that has <em>n-1</em> note onset slices 
  following it.</p>
<p>A <strong>complete vertical interval n-gram</strong> consists of a set of <em>n 
  </em>lists, with one list for each of <em>n </em>qualifying sequential note 
  onset slices, and where each list specifies the vertical intervals between the 
  lowest pitch in the slice and every other unique pitch in the slice (a unison is specified if the lowest pitch is doubled). The vertical intervals 
  indicated by the entries for each list can be expressed in number of semitones, or by generic interval value. 
  The size of each of these lists can vary, depending on the number of unique vertical intervals found in 
  each list's corresponding note onset slice. The ordering of each list is such 
  that the first number indicates the interval between the lowest pitch and the 
  second lowest pitch, the second number indicates the interval between the lowest 
  pitch and the third lowest pitch, etc. If the lowest note in the slice is doubled, then the first number will indicate a unison, and the list continues as described. Note onset slices with no vertical intervals 
  (i.e. where only one note is sounding in the slice) are omitted from vertical 
  interval n-grams. So, for example, the four consecutive note onset slices [C4,E4,G4,C5], 
  [C4], [C4,C4,E4,G4,G4] and [C4,C4] would result in the following complete vertical interval 
  3-gram: [(4,7,12),(0,4,7),(0)]. Note how the second note onset slice was ignored 
  because it did not contain any vertical intervals. In the third note onset slice, the lowest note C4 is doubled, so the second list begins with the unison vertical interval (0). The note G4 is also doubled in this slice, but the second list has only one entry (7) for the vertical interval between the lowest note and the note G4. Vertical intervals are calculated 
  for all pitched (non-MIDI Channel 10) notes in all MIDI track/channel pairings, 
  and neither inclusion nor ordering is influenced by the MIDI track/channel a 
  given pitch is in. Pitches still held in a given note onset slice from a previous 
  slice are included in the list of pitches in the new note onset slice.</p>
<p>Some of the vertical interval features described below focus exclusively on 
  the vertical intervals between the lowest and the highest lines in the music being considered. Such features are calculated using <strong>lowest and highest lines vertical interval n-grams</strong>. This kind of n-gram only considers notes in the lowest and highest lines in the piece, which is to say the two MIDI track/channel pairings with the lowest and highest average pitches, respectively, as calculated across the entire piece of music from which features are being extracted. Notes in all other MIDI track/channel pairings are ignored in lowest and highest lines vertical interval n-grams and the note onset slices they are derived from. This means that only note onset slices that involve 
  a new note in one of these two outer parts are considered; note onset slices 
  corresponding to only new notes in inner lines are ignored. 
   If there are multiple 
  notes sounding in a given note onset slice for either of the lowest or highest lines, then only 
  the lowest or highest note is considered, respectively, in the calculation of lowest and highest lines vertical interval n-grams.</p>
<p>So, lowest and highest lines vertical n-grams each consists of a set of <em>n 
  </em>numbers, with one number for each of <em>n </em>qualifying sequential note 
  onset slices, and where each number specifies the vertical interval between 
  the lowest sounding pitch in the (overall) lowest line and the highest sounding 
  pitch in the (overall) highest line. These vertical intervals can be expressed 
  in number of semitones, with 0 representing a vertical unison, or in generic interval value, and a negative 
  value indicating voice crossing. Note onset slices with no vertical intervals 
  (i.e. where only one note is sounding) are ignored during calculation of lowest 
  and highest lines vertical interval n-grams. Pitches still held in a given note 
  onset slice from a previous slice are included in the list of pitches in the 
  new note onset slice.</p>
  <p>Note that the percentage values by which n-grams are considered rare, common, and very common are different for vertical interval n-gram features than for features based on other varieties of n-grams. The thresholds here are lower because there are generally more unique lowest and highest lines vertical interval n-grams, and even more unique complete vertical interval n-grams, in a piece than there are unique n-grams of other varieties. This is due to the fact that vertical interval n-grams are dependent on changes in more than one MIDI track/channel pairing, and consequently are greater in number and more varied. So, the percentage values have been lowered for both types of vertical interval n-grams in order to generate a number of unique n-grams that are considered rare, common, and very common. The adjusted values were determined through empirical testing on a body of four-voice pieces, which generally are the focus of jSymbolic's machine learning applications, and which also serve as a middle ground between pieces with fewer voices, and pieces with fuller, more complex arrangements. However, these values are still arbitrary indicators of frequency.</p>

<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (RHYTHMIC VALUE N-GRAMS SECTION)</strong></p>

<p> A <strong>rhythmic value n-grams</strong> consists of a set of <em>n</em> values, with one value 
  for each of <em>n </em>sequential note onset slices for a musical line. Each such value specifies 
  a tempo-independent note duration: each (quantized) duration is expressed as 
  a fraction of a quarter note (e.g. a value of 0.5 corresponds to the duration 
  of an eighth note). The possible (rhythmically quantized) values are 0.125, 0.25, 0.33333333, 0.5, 0.66666667, 0.75, 
  1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 12.0. Rhythmic value n-grams (and their 
  associated note onset slices) are first calculated independently for each line 
  (i.e. for each MIDI track/channel pairing), and the resulting n-grams are then 
  all aggregated together into one collection for all lines just before feature calculation. During the calculation 
  for each line, if there are multiple notes in a given note onset slice for a 
  given line, then only the highest pitched note in the slice is included in the calculation 
  of the rhythmic value  n-gram. A new note onset slice is only considered to
occur in this particular type of n-gram if at least one new note in a line is higher in pitch 
  than any still-sounding notes from a previous slice in that line. Rests are  ignored.  MIDI Channel 10 unpitched notes are not included here, 
  as they often represent instruments that cannot hold notes. 
  Rhythmic value n-grams are calculated in sequential sliding windows, with one 
  n-gram for each note note onset slice that has <em>n-1</em> note onset slices 
  following it.</p>
