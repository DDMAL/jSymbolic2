<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>Although features based on overall pitch statistics are often meaningful and useful, they do not reflect information relating to the order in which pitches occur. Melody is a very important part of how many humans hear and think about music, so features based on such sequential information are needed to complement features based on overall pitch statistics. Fortunately, ample theoretical work has been done that can be taken advantage of when designing melodic features, ranging from compositional resources like manuals on writing Baroque counterpoint to more analytically-formulated ideas like melodic contour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  tasks relating to detecting and partitioning musical phrases and melodies, and determining which notes belong to which phrases, are often not  trivial. Although expert humans can perform such tasks relatively easily, automatic systems for performing them have still achieved only limited general success, particularly in cases where the notes in a phrases are shared across voices. So, although a phrase detection pre-processing system would make many potentially useful melodic features accessible, only simple systems that make broad approximations are currently available for doing so.</p>
<p>What one can do fairly easily, however, is collect basic statistics about melodic intervals and melodic motion. Although such statistics may be relatively rudimentary compared to expert melodic analyses, they can still potentially be very effective in performing classifications. One can also extract somewhat more sophisticated features related to melodic contour by making a few naive (but often effective  in a large-scale feature-based context) basic assumptions, such as the assumptions that all notes belonging to a phrase will be on the same MIDI track and channel, or that phrases will each follow the overall shape of a basic concave or converse arc. Although such assumptions are clearly false in the general case, and are certainly not acceptable for any wide-ranging analytical framework, they do make it possible to extract some potentially powerfully discriminating higher-level melodic features without needing a sophisticated phrase detection system.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Note onset slices</strong>&quot;  serve as a useful intermediate abstractions for calculating many of the  features extracted by jSymbolic (including both melodic and other feature types). A new slice is created whenever a new  pitched note attack occurs in the music, and each slice consists of a list of all pitches sounding in the slice. Such slices can be calculated separately for each MIDI track and channel (i.e. individually for each voice), or they can be calculated across all voices simultaneously. jSymbolic also allows slices to be calculated to include notes still sounding from previous slices, or can  calculate slices that only includes pitches starting at the beginning of the current slice.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of note onset slices is that they allow one to deal with the problem that, in practice, notes annotated as sounding simultaneously in a score are often instead encoded such that they begin one-after-the-other with slight time offsets (due either to live encodings of human MIDI performances or to the &quot;human playback settings&quot; used by many score editing packages). Such non-simultaneities can cause significant  problems during automatic feature extraction if not treated carefully. jSymbolic's note onset slice data structures allow it to address this problem by merging notes with very small rhythmic offsets into the same slice, so that analytical processing applied to slices will perceive such notes as if they occurred simultaneously (the jSymbolic code allows customization of the details of how this simultaneity pre-processing is done, but experiments have found the default approach to be effective in general).</p>
<p>From the specific perspective of melodic features, one ideally would like each slice to contain no more than one note for each voice (MIDI track and channel). Of course, polyphonic instruments such as pianos can in fact sound multiple pitches simultaneously on the same MIDI track and channel, which can create ambiguity in determining which note is the &quot;melodic&quot; note for a given slice (i.e. it can be ambiguous in the general case which pitches are part of the melody and which are non-melodic accompaniment). As a useful approximation for calculating slices, jSymbolic adopts the convention that, specifically for the melodic version of its note onset slices, if a given note onset slice on a given MIDI track and channel contains multiple pitches, then only the highest-pitch note in the slice is counted for the purpose of melody calculations. Also, for the melodic version of the note onset slices, if the highest note is sustained from one  slice to the next, and is still the highest note in the second slice, then this is treated as if there is no change in melody, even if lower pitches in the same track and channel change. A series of melodic intervals can then be calculated for each voice by comparing the  melodic note in each slice with the last melodic note found in a prior slice. Similar bassline-oriented processing can also be done by only considering the lowest note in each slice.</p>
<p>A <strong>melodic interval histogram</strong> is also proposed here as a way of facilitating the extraction of certain basic features relating to melodic intervals. Each bin of this histogram represents a different melodic interval, and is labeled with an index indicating the number of semitones in the interval. The histogram is populated by going through the music in question, voice by voice, and noting the interval (in number of semitones) between the melodic note in each note onset slice and the melodic note in the previous slice. The magnitude of each histogram bin indicates the fraction of such melodic intervals that correspond to the bin's melodic interval. The direction of the interval (i.e. up or down in pitch) is ignored in the base form of this histogram. This histogram clearly has a few limitations, of course. For example, it treats all voices equally, even though the highest line of a piece often carries the most significant melodic information. It is, however, a quick and easy approach that has been found experimentally to often be helpful in discriminating between classes. As noted in the feature descriptions below, there are a few varieties of these melodic interval histograms.</p>
<p>Another intermediate data structure is also used by jSymbolic to help calculate some of the features listed below. This consists of a list of MIDI channels, where each entry of the list contains an array. This array entry for a given MIDI channel consists of a list of all melodic intervals, in semitones, for the associated channel. The numbers representing the intervals in this second intermediate data structure are set to negative for downward motion and to positive for upward motion.</p>
<p>As a final note, all notes occurring on MIDI Channel 10 (reserved for unpitched instruments) are ignored for all of the features described in this section. This is because the “pitch” values on Channel 10 correspond to  instruments, not to pitches.</p>
<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (MELODY AND MELODIC INTERVALS SECTION)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>M-1 Melodic Interval Histogram:</strong> A feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the melodic interval histogram described above. Each bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the interval associated with the bin (there are 128 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated pitches, bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone, bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones, etc. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the piece that are of the kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized). Rising and falling intervals are treated as identical. Melodies are assumed to be contained within individual MIDI tracks and channels, so melodic intervals are found separately for each track and channel before being combined in this histogram. If a given note onset slice on a given MIDI track and channel contains multiple pitches, then only the highest pitched note in the slice is counted for the purpose of melody calculations. Also, if the highest note is sustained from one note onset slice to the next, and is still the highest note in the second slice, then this is treated as if there is no change in melody, even if lower pitches in the same track and channel change. It is also assumed that melodies do not cross MIDI tracks or channels (i.e. that they are each separately contained in their own track and channel). Only pitched notes are considered, so all notes on the unpitched MIDI Channel 10 are ignored.</li>

Entries for melodic intervals over an octave are amalgamated (e.g. 2nds and 9ths are combined). Each bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the interval associated with the bin (there are 12 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated pitches (and octave multiples), bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone (and octave multiples), bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones (and octave multiples), etc. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the piece that are of the kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized).

Entries for melodic intervals over an octave are amalgamated (e.g. 2nds and 9ths are combined). Each bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the interval associated with the bin (there are 12 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated pitches (and octave multiples), bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone (and octave multiples), bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones (and octave multiples), etc. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the highest voice that are of the kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized). Rising and falling intervals are treated as identical. If a given note onset slice for the highest voice contains multiple pitches, then only the highest pitched note in the slice is counted for the purpose of melody calculations. Also, if the highest note is sustained from one note onset slice to the next, and is still the highest note in the second slice, then this is treated as if there is no change in melody, even if lower pitches change. </font></font></li>
