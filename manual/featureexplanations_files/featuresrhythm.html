<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>Before delving into the details of the rhythm related features, it should be noted that they are annotated  using a numbering system that divides them into two groups. The &quot;R&quot; group features are not influenced by tempo or note dynamics, and the &quot;RT&quot; group features are influenced by tempo and, sometimes, by dynamics. This division is adopted because, depending on the particular research application, it is sometimes useful to have features that take information  related to  such performance information into account (e.g. if the corpus from which features are to be extracted is meticulously encoded in a way that consistently makes use of this information), and it is sometimes useful to omit this information (e.g. if the corpus holds music drawn from different sources that encoded the music differently, and where the encodings themselves could therefore bias feature values). Sometimes it might be useful to use just the R features, sometimes just the RT features and sometimes both; the decision is left to the user based on the particular research project the user is interested in.</p>
<p>The two elementary pieces of information from which most rhythmic features can be calculated are the times at which notes begin (&quot;note onsets&quot;) relative to one another, and the durations of individual notes. Note onsets can be extracted relatively reliably from audio data, at least in cases where note density is not too high, but durations can be more difficult to extract reliably. In the case of symbolic data, however, both note onsets and durations are easily and precisely available. As one might expect, several of the rhythmic features that are based on note onsets in the jSymbolic catalogue are  similar to features that are often used in audio feature extraction systems. Duration-based features, in contrast, are very rarely currently used by audio feature extraction software, but are  included in the jSymbolic feature catalogue.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to discuss the details of the jSymbolic rhythmic feature catalogue, it is important to emphasize certain details of how MIDI files encode rhythmic information; these must be considered when designing rhythmic features, whether for jSymbolic or for some other MIDI-compatible software. Time is measured in MIDI files using regular pulses called &quot;ticks.&quot; The duration of each quantized quarter note is assigned a set number of ticks, referred to as &quot;Pulses Per Quarter Note&quot; or &quot;PPQ.&quot; The time rate at which ticks go by is set by MIDI tempo meta-events, which in effect control the time duration of each tick (the default MIDI tempo is 120 BPM, if no tempo meta-events specify it explicitly). MIDI tempo is specified in terms of &quot;beats per minute&quot; or &quot;BPM,&quot; where each beat in MIDI is considered to be a quarter note (regardless of the time signature). These tempo meta-events can occur at any point in a MIDI sequence, which means that the tempo can be different at different points in the same MIDI sequence. The PPQ setting, in contrast, is constant throughout each sequence. So, the number of ticks associated with a quarter note never changes within a given MIDI sequence, but the time duration of a quarter note will change if a tempo meta-event changes the time duration of these ticks at some point in the sequence.</p>
<p>One can  determine the time duration of a note by counting the number of ticks that go by between a MIDI Note On and its associated Note Off, and combining this with the duration of these ticks as set by the tempo. One can also determine the rhythmic value (e.g. half note, eighth  note, etc.) of a note by counting the ticks between a Note On and the corresponding Note Off, and then combining this with the PPQ setting.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of symbolic data is that some important rhythmic features are related to performance characteristics that are not always available in symbolic data, or available in only a very coarse sense. For example, musical scores may indicate that a piece should be played rubato or with a swing rhythm. There is a great deal of variety in the ways in which these rhythmic performance styles can be interpreted, something that can be of essential importance for tasks such as performer identification. Although certain symbolic formats (including MIDI) can represent relatively precise note start and end timings, and many recorded MIDI performances do indeed take advantage of this, MIDI files generated using score editing software are often strictly quantized rhythmically, which means that performance timing information is not always consistently available. Conversely, sometimes one might prefer for music theoretical reasons that performance interpretation be taken out of the equation, in which case non-quantized rhythms must be quantized in order to be interpreted consistently.</p>
<p>Happily, jSymbolic processing allows features associated with both quantized and non-quantized rhythms to be extracted, as suits a given musical task's needs. Related to this, several of the rhythm features described below  are based on various histograms. These histograms are used partly done to statistically smooth over inconsistencies due to rhythm encoding style, and partly simply because such histograms can yield useful features in general.</p>
<p>  The first rhythm-related histogram generated by jSymbolic, which focuses on note durations rather than note onsets, is called the <strong>rhythmic value histogram</strong>. It is is a normalized histogram where the value of each bin specifies the fraction of all notes in the piece with a quantized rhythmic value  corresponding to that of the given bin. The bins are numbered as follows: thirty second notes (or less)s [0], sixteenth notes [1], eighth notes [2], dotted eighth notes [3], quarter notes [4], dotted quarter notes [5], half notes [6], dotted half notes [7], whole notes [8], dotted whole notes [9], double whole notes [10] and dotted double whole notes (or more ) [11].</p>
<p>
  Both pitched and unpitched notes are included in this histogram. Tempo is, of course, not relevant to this histogram. Notes with durations not precisely matching one of these rhythmic note values are mapped to the closest note value (to filter out the effects of rubato or uneven human rhythmic performances, for example). This histogram is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</p>
<p>jSymbolic also generates two additional  histograms based on quantized rhythmic values: the <strong>rhythmic value median run lengths histogram</strong> and the 
  <strong>rhythmic value variability in run lengths histogram</strong>. These each have twelve bins matching the same rhythmic values associated by the rhythmic value histogram, but instead of being based on the fraction of these rhythmic values overall, they are concerned with how long same-voice runs of notes with the same rhythmic value are.</p>
<p>An entirely different type of rhythm-related histogram generated by jSymbolic is the <strong>beat histogram</strong>, which focuses on note onsets rather than durations (unlike the rhythmic value histogram, which looks at durations). Beat histograms are an approach that was first applied to MIR research by Brown (1993), and was later publicized and used for automatic genre classification by Tzanetakis and his colleagues in a number of papers (Tzanetakis, Essl &amp; Cook 2001; Tzanetakis &amp; Cook 2002; Tzanetakis 2002).</p>
<p>It is necessary to have some understanding of how autocorrelation works in order to understand how beat histograms are constructed. Autocorrelation essentially involves comparing a signal with versions of itself delayed by successive intervals. This technique is often used to find repeating patterns in signals of any kind, as it yields the relative strengths of different periodicities within a signal. In terms of musical data, autocorrelation allows one to find the relative strengths of different rhythmic pulses. jSymbolic constructs its rhythmic histograms by processing sequences of MIDI Note On events, with MIDI ticks comprising the time scale. The value is calculated to be proportional to the velocity of Note Ons in order to ensure that beats are weighted based on the strength with which notes are played.  The values of lag correspond to both rhythmic periodicities as well as, after processing, the bin labels of the beat histogram, and the autocorrelation values provide the magnitude value for each bin. Calculations use the overall average tempo of the piece, in order to emphasize the metrical notation of the recording, and do thus do not take into account tempo variations in the piece due to the potential presence of multiple tempo MIDI meta-events.</p>
<p>Once the histogram is populated using all permissible values of lag for a given MIDI sequence, jSymbolic then downsamples and transforms it so that each bin corresponds to a rhythmic periodicity with units of beats per minute. The histogram is then normalized so that different MIDI sequences can be compared. The end result is a histogram whose bins correspond to rhythmic pulses with units of beats per minute and whose bin magnitudes indicate the relative strength of each such rhythmic pulse. In effect, a beat histogram portrays the relative strength of different beats and sub-beats within a piece.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the beat histograms extracted from MIDI representations of I Wanna Be Sedated, by the punk band The Ramones, and ’Round Midnight, by the jazz performer and composer Thelonious Monk, as shown below. It is clear that I Wanna Be Sedated has significant rhythmic looseness, as demonstrated by the spread around each peak, each of which represents a strong beat periodicity. I Wanna Be Sedated also has several clear strong beats, including ones centered at 55, 66, 82, 111 (the actual tempo of the song) and 164 beats per minute, the latter two of which are harmonics of 55 and 82 beats per minute. ’Round Midnight, in contrast, has one very strong beat at 76 beats per minute, the actual tempo of the piece, and a wide range of much lower-level beat strengths. This indicates that, as might be expected, ’Round Midnight is more rhythmically complex and is also performed more tightly.</p>

<p><img src="Round_Midnight.gif"></p>
<p>This type of information can be very representative of different musical classes, such as genre. Techno, for example, often has very clearly defined beats, without any surrounding spread, because the beats are precisely generated electronically. Much modern Classical music, to provide a contrasting example, often has much less clearly defined beats.</p>

  <li><font color="#000000"><strong>R-51 Variability of Partial Rest Durations:</strong> Standard deviation of the durations of rests in the piece, expressed as a fraction of the duration of a quarter note. This is calculated voice-by-voice, where each rest included in the calculation corresponds to a rest in one MIDI channel, regardless of what may or may not be happening simultaneously in any other MIDI channels. Non-pitched (MIDI channel 10) notes ARE considered in this calculation. Only channels containing at least one note are counted in this calculation. Rests shorter than 0.1 of a quarter note are ignored in this calculation.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000"><strong>R-52 Variability Across Voices of Combined Rests:</strong> Standard deviation of the total amount of time  (expressed as a fraction of the duration of a quarter note) per active MIDI channel in which no notes are sounding in that channel. Only channels containing at least one note are counted in this calculation. Non-pitched (MIDI channel 10) notes ARE considered in this calculation.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000"><strong>R-53 Beat Histogram Tempo Standardized:</strong> A  feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the beat histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. However, the tempo of the music is standardized to 120 BPM throughout the piece before this histogram is calculated. This means that variations in tempo within a single piece are in effect eliminated for the purposes of this histogram. The tempo-independent beat histograms of different pieces can also be compared in a way that is independent of potential tempo differences between the pieces. Rubato and dynamics do still influence the tempo-independent beat histogram, however. Also, the first 40 bins are not included in this feature vector, as is the case with the basic beat histogram, and only (tranformed) periodicities up to 260 BPM are considered. . Each bin corresponds to a different beats per minute periodicity, with tempo increasing with the bin index. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the cumulative loudness (MIDI velocity) of the notes that occur at that bin's rhythmic periodicity. The histogram is normalized.</font></li>
