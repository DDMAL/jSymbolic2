<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>There is certain information that cannot be encoded in jSymbolic's native <a href="https://www.midi.org/" target="top">MIDI</a>, due to inherent representational limitations of the MIDI format. jSymbolic uses a separate data pipeline to provide access to  information of this kind that can instead be encoded in <a href="http://music-encoding.org/" target="top">MEI</a>, and jSymbolic can use &quot;MEI-specific features,&quot; such as those described below, to extract useful information from this pipeline. In other words, jSymbolic uses MEI-specific features to access information that is available in <a href="http://music-encoding.org/" target="top">MEI</a> files, but cannot be encoded in <a href="https://www.midi.org/" target="top">MIDI</a>. MEI-specific features should  only be used when extracting features from a musical collection consisting exclusively of MEI files, as a feature set extracted from a mixture of MIDI and MEI files would be inconsistent if MEI-specific features are  available for MEI instances but not for MIDI instances.</p>
<p>Note that jSymbolic can only parse MEI files conforming to the effective &quot;standard&quot;  MEI encoding specification as it existed in 2017, when jSymbolic's MEI parser was implemented (see the <a href="../introduction_files/introduction.html">introductory</a> section of this manual for more details on this).</p>
<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (MEI-SPECIFIC FEATURES SECTION)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>S-1 Number of Grace Notes:</strong> The total number of grace notes in a piece (i.e. the number of notes indicated as grace notes in the MEI encoding) divided by the total number of pitched notes in the music.</li>
  <li><strong>S-2 Number of Slurs:</strong> The total number of notes marked with slurs in the piece (i.e. the number of notes indicated as notes with slurs in the MEI encoding) divided by the total number of pitched notes in the music.</li>
</ul>
