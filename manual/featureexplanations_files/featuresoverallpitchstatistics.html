<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>
<p>The majority of traditional analytical systems place a particular emphasis on information related to pitch and, as one would expect, this type of information certainly has important value with respect to symbolic features as well. jSymbolic's pitch-related features focus on overall statistics on the pitches present in a piece, without regard to the temporal location of notes in relation to one another (features that do, in contrast, account for the context of notes and their pitches are described in other sections of this manual).</p>

<p>One particularly useful approach to calculating statistical features is to construct histograms, which consist of a set of bins each indicating some measurable quantity (e.g. how often each possible pitch occurs in a piece), and where the magnitude (or &quot;frequency&quot;) of each bin indicates how often that quantity occurs in the piece. The jSymbolic feature catalogue uses  modified versions of the three pitch histograms implemented by Tzanetakis and his colleagues (Tzanetakis and Cook 2002; Tzanetakis, Ermolinskyi and Cook 2002; Tzanetakis 2002).</p>
<p>The first type of histogram is a <strong>basic pitch histogram</strong>. It consists of 128 bins, one for each MIDI pitch. The magnitude of each bin is first set to the number of Note On messages in the piece with the corresponding pitch, and the histogram is normalized after all Note On messages have been accounted for. This type of histogram gives particular insights into the range and variety of pitches used in a piece.</p>
<p>To provide practical examples, the first figure below shows the basic pitch histogram for a Duke Ellington jazz piece, and the second shows the histogram for a Dr. Dre rap song. A number of genre-typical differences are immediately apparent from even a rough visual comparison of these two histograms, such as the fact that the rap song uses far fewer pitches than the jazz piece, for example.</p>
<p><img src="Sophisticated_Lady.gif"></p>
<p><img src="Forgot_About_Dre.gif"></p>
<p>The second type of histogram is called a <strong>pitch class histogram</strong>. It has one bin for each of the twelve pitch classes, which means that it is essentially a version of the basic pitch histogram where octaves are collapsed for each of the pitch classes. The magnitude of each bin is set to the number of Note On messages with a MIDI pitch that can be wrapped to this pitch class, with enharmonic equivalents assigned to the same pitch class number. The histogram is normalized, and the bins are translated so that the first bin corresponds to the pitch class with the highest magnitude, with the successive bins ordered chromatically in semitone increments. This type of histogram provides insights into areas such as the types of scales used and the amount of transposition that is present, for example.</p>
<p>The third type of histogram is called a <strong>folded fifths pitch class histogram</strong>, and is derived directly from the pitch class histogram. This histogram is calculated by reordering the bins of the original unordered pitch class histogram such that adjacent bins are separated by perfect fifths rather than semitones. This is done using the following equation:</p>
<p>B = (7a)mod(12)</p>
<p>where B is the folded fifths pitch histogram bin and a is the corresponding pitch class histogram bin. The number seven is used because this is the number of semitones in a perfect fifth, and the number twelve is used because there are twelve pitch classes in total. This histogram is useful for measuring dominant-tonic relationships and for looking at types of transpositions.	</p>
<p>The utility of the folded fifths pitch histogram can be seen by comparing the first figure below, which shows the folded fifths pitch histogram for a Baroque Vivaldi concerto, with the second figure below, which shows the folded fifths pitch histogram for an atonal Schoenberg piano miniature. The Vivaldi piece never or rarely uses five of the twelve pitch classes, and the pitch classes that are used are clustered around one section of the circle of fifths. These are characteristics that one would typically expect of basic tonal music without many tonally distant modulations or significant use of chromaticism. In contrast, all of the pitch classes are used to a significant degree in the Schoenberg piece, and the most frequently used pitch classes are not clustered together on the circle of fifths, both of which are characteristics that one would expect of such an atonal piece.</p>

<p><img src="Schoenberg.gif""></p>
<p>All three of these histogram types are included directly as features in the jSymbolic feature catalogue, and are also used to calculate a number of other features. </p>
<p>Part of the challenge of histogram-related features is that one must find a way to represent the information embedded in them as useful features. Although histograms like the three described above certainly can be used directly as feature vectors, experience has shown that machine learning algorithms can sometimes (but not always) have trouble learning to extract useful information from them in this raw form if they are too large. Feature histograms are, however, very useful in providing an intermediate data structure from which other features can be extracted. Experience has shown informally that the two highest peaks of  histograms tend to be of particular importance in extracting such information, and they are used as the basis for a number of features.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of the jSymbolic features represent pitch as MIDI does, with 128 pitches (numbered 0 to 127), and with middle C set at note 60. A disadvantage with this approach, of course, is that enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch number. Although this is not ideal, as it involves the loss of some potentially useful information, it is unavoidable given the need to be able to parse MIDI files and compare features extracted from MIDI files with features extracted from files in formats such as MEI. Fortunately, most of the jSymbolic features are not impacted by this loss of information. If one wishes to exclusively extract features from formats such as MEI that do distinguish between enharmonic equivalents, then jSymbolic can certainly still be used, although one will need to implement <a href="featuresmeispecific.html">MEI-specific features</a> that take advantage of jSymbolic's existing pipeline of MEI-specific data.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that all notes occurring on MIDI channel ten are ignored for all of the features described in this section. This is because the &quot;pitch&quot; values on channel ten correspond to (mostly unpitched) percussion instruments, not to pitches.</p>
<p>Some of the features in this section are based on MIDI Pitch Bends. Although the use of Pitch Bends is somewhat variable from MIDI encoder to MIDI encoder, and therefore particularly sensitive to inconsistent encoding practices, features relating to Pitch Bends can nonetheless have a high discriminating power, so they are included here so that they can be used when properly encoded data is available. Efforts were made to use features with as limited a sensitivity to encoding bias as possible.</p>
