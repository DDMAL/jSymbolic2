<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>Chords in general, and tonal harmony in particular, are the areas that have typically received the most attention in traditional Western analytical systems. It is essential to point out that the existing theoretical frameworks based on tonal harmony do not apply to many kinds of music, as they were developed primarily with respect to Western classical music. As a consequence, most of the chord-based features proposed as part of the jSymbolic feature library are not based on harmonic function, and emphasize instead basic statistical information about the vertical intervals between pitches that sound simultaneously. Having recognized this, it is once again important to recall that features are useful simply if they help to differentiate between classes statistically, even if they are inspired by theoretical assumptions that do not apply to some of the music under consideration. There are therefore certain features in the jSymbolic catalogue that make use of certain basic concepts that are specific to Western harmonic theory.</p>
<p>Two new histograms are proposed as intermediate data structures for calculating chord-based structures. The first, called a <strong>vertical interval histogram</strong>, consists of bins associated with different vertical intervals and labeled with the number of semitones in the corresponding interval. The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI  tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. This is done exhaustively, so that multiple vertical intervals will be noted per tick if there are more than two pitches sounding simultaneously. The histogram is then normalized. The end result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. This is reasonable, since long notes often have greater harmonic significance than short notes, and stressed notes tend to be more harmonically important than notes played more softly. This histogram does not incorporate any tonal assumptions, although it does require quantization into the twelve standard Western pitches (i.e. microtones are not considered). Another histogram, the <strong>wrapped vertical interval histogram</strong>, is also found: it simply consists of the vertical interval histogram wrapped by octave, such that there are 12 bins.</p>
<p>
  It is also potentially useful to have a histogram that can be used to extract features more directly related to tonal harmony, since many music classification projects do involve music based on the basic chord ontologies of Western music. A <strong>chord type histogram</strong> is generated with this need in mind. This is a normalized histogram that has bins labeled with types of chords (in the following order and with the indicated identifying codes): partial chords consisting of just two pitch classes [0], minor triads [1], major triads [2], diminished triads [3], augmented triads [4], other triads [5], minor seventh chords [6], dominant seventh chords [7], major seventh chords [8], other chords consisting of four pitch classes [9], and complex chords with more than four pitch classes [10]. The bin magnitudes are calculated by going through MIDI ticks one by one and incrementing the counter for the bin that corresponds to the chord, if any, that is present during each given tick; the result is that the chords in this histogram are weighted by the duration with which each chord is played. All inversions are treated as equivalent and octave doubling is ignored in the calculation of this histogram.</p>
<p>
  None of these histograms provide any information about arpeggiation, unfortunately, but some information related to this is collected during the melodic feature extraction. A more sophisticated system in the future could integrate vertical statistics with arpeggios, and could also collect information about inversions as well as chord transitions in order to obtain more sophisticated and accurate features. </p>
<p>
  Once again, all notes occurring on MIDI channel ten are ignored for all of the features described in this section. This is because the &quot;pitch&quot;   values on channel ten correspond to percussion instruments, not to pitches.</p>
<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (CHORDS AND VERTICAL INTERVALS SECTION)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>	C-1 Vertical Interval Histogram:</strong> A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison) to 127 (a vertical interval of 127 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. The result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. This histogram is first normalized, then bin magnitudes under .001 are filtered out and set to 0 to reduce noise. Finally, the histogram is re-normalized.</li>
  <li><strong>C-2 Wrapped Vertical Interval Histogram:</strong> A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the wrapped vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison) to 11 (a vertical interval of 11 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. Intervals larger than 11 semitones are wrapped (e.g. an octave (12 semitones) is added to the bin for unisons (0 semitones)). The result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. This histogram is first normalized, then bin magnitudes under .001 are filtered out and set to 0 to reduce noise. Finally, the histogram is re-normalized.</li>
