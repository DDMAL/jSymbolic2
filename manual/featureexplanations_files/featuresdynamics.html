<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>The ways in which musical dynamics are used in a piece can also be characteristic of different types of musical classes. Once again, however, this information is only rarely used in traditional analytical systems, and is generally notated only very coarsely in musical scores. Fortunately, MIDI velocity values make it possible to annotate dynamics much more precisely, even though MIDI encodings generated by score editing software admittedly generally fail to take full advantage of this.</p>

<p>One important point to consider with respect to MIDI dynamics is that, while MIDI velocities are generally used to indicate the strength with which notes are sounded, this is not the only way in which loudness is controlled. MIDI channel volume can also be changed independently. jSymbolic takes this into account by using the following formula to find loudness values used to calculate the features described in this sub-section:</p>

<p>loudness = note velocity x (channel volume / 127)</p>

<p>It should also be noted that all of the jSymbolic features related to dynamics use relative measures of loudness rather than absolute measures because the default volume and velocity values set by sequencers can vary.</p>

<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (DYNAMICS SECTION)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>D-1 Dynamic Range: </strong>Loudness of the loudest note in the piece, minus the loudness of the softest note.</li>
  <li><strong>D-2 Variation of Dynamics: </strong>Standard deviation of  loudness levels across all notes.</li>
  <li><strong>D-3 Variation of Dynamics in Each Voice:</strong> Standard deviations of note loudness levels within each MIDI channel, averaged across all channels. Only channels that contain at least one note are included in this calculation.</li>
  <li><strong>D-4 Average Note to Note  Change in Dynamics:</strong> Average change of loudness from one note to the next note in the same MIDI channel.
  </li>
</ul>
