<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>The ways in which musical dynamics are used in music can  be stylistically characteristic of many different types of musical categories of interest. Dynamics are only rarely used in traditional analytical systems, however, and are mostly notated only very coarsely in musical scores. Fortunately, MIDI velocity values make it possible to annotate dynamics much more precisely in MIDI files, especially when the MIDI is generated using live performance capture. Unfortunately, score editing software often generates MIDI encodings with little or no meaningful information on dynamics, and some score editing software may artificially introduce limited dynamics if  &quot;expressive&quot; or &quot;human&quot; playback settings are enabled during encoding (see the section of the manual on  <a href="featuresrhythm.html">rhythm features</a> for a brief discussion of such score editor settings). Those using the jSymbolic dynamic features described  below should be aware of how the music they are analyzing was encoded. If the music was encoded using consistent live performance capture, or using software that consistently encodes MIDI velocity information in musically meaningful ways, then the below features could be quite useful. However, if inconsistent methodologies for encoding of dynamics were used when generating the corpus under consideration, then it is better to omit these features, as dynamics will be subject to encoding bias. Alternatively, if no dynamics are encoded in a given corpus, then the features below will not provide any useful information.</p>

<p>One important point to consider with respect to MIDI dynamics is that, while MIDI velocities are generally used to indicate the strength with which notes are sounded, this is not the only way in which loudness is controlled. MIDI channel volume can also be changed independently. jSymbolic takes this into account by using the following formula to find loudness values used to calculate the features described in this sub-section:</p>

<p>loudness = note velocity x (channel volume / 127)</p>

<p>It should also be noted that all of the jSymbolic features related to dynamics use relative measures of loudness rather than absolute measures because the default volume and velocity values set by sequencers can vary.</p>

<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (DYNAMICS SECTION)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>D-1 Dynamic Range: </strong>Loudness of the loudest note in the piece, minus the loudness of the softest note.</li>
  <li><strong>D-2 Variation of Dynamics: </strong>Standard deviation of  loudness levels across all notes.</li>
  <li><strong>D-3 Variation of Dynamics in Each Voice:</strong> Standard deviations of note loudness levels within each MIDI channel, averaged across all channels. Only channels that contain at least one note are included in this calculation.</li>
  <li><strong>D-4 Average Note to Note  Change in Dynamics:</strong> Average change of loudness from one note to the next note in the same MIDI channel.
  </li>
</ul>
