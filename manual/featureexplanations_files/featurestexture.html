<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>Although the term &quot;texture&quot; is associated with several different musical meanings, the features falling into this category of the jSymbolic feature catalogue relate specifically to the number of independent voices in a piece and how these voices relate to one another.</p>

<p>  jSymbolic takes advantage of the fact that MIDI notes can be assigned to different &quot;channels&quot; and/or &quot;tracks&quot; (depending on the MIDI file type), thus making it possible to segregate notes belonging to different voices. The texture features described below operate under the definition of a &quot;voice&quot; as such a track/channel pairing (Channel 10, reserved for unpitched notes, is excluded from all of these features). This approach is not perfect, as it is in theory possible for encoders to multiplex multiple virtual voices onto a single track/channel using MIDI Program Change messages, but in practice this is very rarely done since the advent of MIDI File Type 1.</p>
<p>Another potential issue is that polyphonic instruments can combine multiple simultaneous notes in a single voice (MIDI track/channel combination). For example, a piano could be used to play a four-voice chorale, with all notes occurring on one MIDI track/channel. This problem is unavoidable with respect to MIDI (and most other) encodings, unfortunately, unless one implements a sophisticated voice partitioning pre-processing module to automatically segregate voices prior to feature extraction, something that is beyond the  scope of this work. The features described below deal with this potential issue when necessary in ways appropriate to each feature. Ultimately, however, it is best to use a musical corpus that has been consistently and universally encoded using proper voice partitioning into separate MIDI track/channel combinations.</p>
<p>Some of the features below base their calculation on &quot;note onset slices.&quot; See the manual section on <a href="featuresngrams.html">n-gram sequences</a> for an explanation of how these are implemented.</p>

<p>The reader may note that some of the features below pay special attention to the loudest voice, which is to say the voice with the highest average MIDI velocity. This is an imperfect but often effective method for guessing which voice carries the melody, or is in some other way the most important voice. If a particular corpus does not include specifications of dynamics, then these features should be excluded.</p>
