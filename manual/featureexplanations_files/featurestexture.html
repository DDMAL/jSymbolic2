<p><strong>GENERAL NOTES</strong></p>

<p>Although the term &quot;texture&quot; is associated with several different musical meanings, the features falling into this category of the jSymbolic catalogue relate specifically to the number of independent voices in a piece and how these voices relate to one another.</p>

<p>  jSymbolic takes advantage of the fact that MIDI notes can be assigned to different channels, thus making it possible to segregate the notes belonging to different voices. Although it might seem natural to use MIDI tracks instead of channels to distinguish between voices, since only a maximum of sixteen MIDI channels are available, this is an ineffective approach in practice. Using MIDI tracks would mean that it would be impossible to extract texture-based features from all Type 0 MIDI files, since this format only allow permits a single track to be represented. Even in the case of Type 1 files, which do allow tracks to be specified, it is still not unusual to find all MIDI data saved on a single track in practice. Almost all MIDI files do use different channels for different voices, however, and it is possible to take advantage of Program Change messages to multiplex multiple voices onto a single channel in order to avoid being restricted to only sixteen voices. It was therefore decided to use MIDI channels in order to distinguish between voices rather than MIDI tracks.</p>

<p>This approach is not perfect, as it is possible to use a single channel to hold multiple voices even without regular program change messages. A piano could be used to play a four-voice chorale, for example, with all notes occurring on one MIDI channel. This problem is unavoidable with respect to MIDI data, unfortunately, unless one implements a sophisticated voice partitioning pre-processing module to automatically segregate voices prior to feature extraction, something that is beyond the current scope of this work. Fortunately, this problem does not occur  often in MIDI files.</p>
<p>An astute reader will also note that some of the features below pay special attention to the loudest voice, which is to say to voice with the highest average MIDI velocity. This is an imperfect but often effective method for guessing which voice carries the melody, or is in some other way the most important voice.</p>

<p><strong>JSYMBOLIC FEATURE CATALOGUE (TEXTURE SECTION)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>T-1 Maximum Number of Independent Voices:</strong> Maximum number of different channels in which notes are sounded simultaneously.</li>
  <li><strong>T-2 Average Number of Independent Voices:</strong> Average number of different channels in which notes are sounded simultaneously. Rests are not included in this calculation.</li>
  <li><strong>T-3 Variability of Number of Independent Voices:</strong> Standard deviation of the number of different channels in which notes are sounded simultaneously at each given moment (MIDI tick). Rests are not included in this calculation.</li>
  <li><strong>T-4 Voice Equality – Number of Notes:</strong> Standard deviation of the total number of Note Ons in each channel that contains at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-5 Voice Equality – Note Duration:</strong> Standard deviation of the cumulative amount of time during which one or more notes were sounding in each channel that contains at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-6 Voice Equality – Dynamics:</strong> Standard deviation of the average loudness (MIDI velocity) of notes in each channel that contains at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-7 Voice Equality – Melodic Leaps:</strong> Standard deviation of the average melodic leap distance of each channel that contains at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-8 Voice Equality – Range:</strong> Standard deviation of the differences between the highest and lowest pitches in each channel that contains at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-9 Importance of Loudest Voice:</strong> Difference between the average loudness (MIDI velocity) of the loudest channel and the average loudness of the other channels that contain at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-10 Relative Range of Loudest Voice:</strong> Difference between the highest note and the lowest note played in the channel with the highest average loudness (MIDI velocity), divided by the difference between the highest note and the lowest note in the piece as a whole. Set to 0 if there if there are fewer than 2 pitches in the music.</li>
  <li><strong>T-11 Relative Range Isolation of Loudest Voice:</strong> Number of pitched notes in the MIDI channel with the highest average loudness that fall outside the range of any other pitched channel, divided by the total number of notes in the channel with the highest average loudness. Set to 0 if there are only 0 or 1 channels containing pitched notes.</li>
  <li><strong>T-12 Relative Range of Highest Line:</strong> Pitch difference in semitones between the highest note and the lowest note played in the channel with the highest average pitch, divided by the difference between the highest note and the lowest note in the piece overall. Set to 0 if there if there are fewer than 2 pitches in the music.</li>
  <li><strong>T-13 Relative Note Density of Highest Line:</strong> Number of Note Ons in the channel with the highest average pitch, divided by the average number of Note Ons in all channels that contain at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-14 Relative Note Durations of Lowest Line:</strong> Average duration of notes (in seconds) in the channel with the lowest average pitch, divided by the average duration of notes in all channels that contain at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-15 Relative Size of Melodic Intervals in Lowest Line:</strong> Average melodic interval in semitones in the channel with the lowest average pitch, divided by the average melodic interval in all channels that contain at least two notes.</li>
  <li><strong>T-16 Voice Overlap:</strong> Number of notes played within the range of another channel, divided by the total number of notes in the piece as a whole.</li>
  <li><strong>T-17 Voice Separation:</strong> Average separation in semitones between the average pitches of consecutive channels (after sorting based on average pitch) that contain at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-18 Variability of Voice Separation:</strong> Average separation in semi-tones between the average pitches of consecutive channels (after sorting based on average pitch) that contain at least one note.</li>
  <li><strong>T-19 Parallel Motion:</strong> Fraction of movements between voices that consist of parallel motion (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation. Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief look-ahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance). Only unique pitches are included in this calculation (unisons are treated as a single pitch). All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing. </li>
  <li><strong>T-20 Similar Motion:</strong> Fraction of movements between voices that consist of similar motion (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation. Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief look-ahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance).
